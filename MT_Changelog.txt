then the bigger cannons


Available buildings to build:

 It will be used to purchase weapons, items and ammo as well some buildings
 like the Comet Catcher and Upgrade Center

-Material Maker
 It will provide you resource which are essentials for getting 
 ammunition and better items 
 
-Ore Refinery
 its sole purpose is to refine comet raw ore
 
-Comet Catcher
 Basically a upgraded Ore Extractor, it makes falling ore comets 
 which gives comet materials later on when used on refinery

-Science Center
 Here you can improve the performance of your weapons
 and getting experimental weapons/items


-Ammo Factory
 It is cheaper to build compared to the Arms Dealer
 but you can only get lower ammo tiers like the HE, things like FAE or Laser 
 ammo would not be available
 
-Repair Pad
 you go at it and you get repaired - is it that hard? 
 
Some changes to gameplay:
Instead of collecting items placed around the map
you have to build some structures to get resources and items


Changes to Cannon:
All different cannon type like Blahblah* AP, blah* HE cannot be selected
anymore instead you need to cycle the ammo type which needs to be binded 
in configuration menu named "Switch Cannon Ammo (Right)"


Thanks to Nascence for the ACS script.
