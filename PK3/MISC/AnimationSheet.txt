This sheet will be used to make all Actors using models share the same frame 
names. So for example there is Actor Infantry and Actor Infantry-Rocket
[A] Infantry uses for walking animation these frames:
WA00-WA15 , while Infantry-Rocket just uses MO00-MO10 

And where is the problem there? Simple, eventhrough those 2 frames are just 
walking animation which will be anyway used for the see state and it would 
make editing between those 2 troublesome so and the solution is simple to make
the Infantry-Rocket uses the same actor naming sheme as everybody else.

Whic will give us this:

Actor Infantry...

See:
WA00 .... do shit

WA08 ... do more shit

Actor Infantry-Rocket...

See:
WA00 .... do junk
