TODO (in short form):
Weapons:
-Weapons,Ammo need balance
-Improved weapons system
-Improve Invendiary Impact
-Better sound effects, give weapons etc a "OMPH" effect
-Decals (25% Done)


5 ammo type maximum
Remove: Buckshot, Incendiary Shell (Replace them with something else)
50,75,88mm Cannon:
AP Shell (Shell, due to small explosive amount, piercing)
APCR Shell (Improved variant of AP Shell, more expensive, piercing)
HEAT Shell* (Combo of AP/HE)
HE Shell (medium explosion radius, medium damage)

Candiates:
Nuclear Shell, (Or maybe T2 upgrade should have a nuclear like effect)
Acid shell? Could be actually useful against armors since it can plausible melt
metals. 


Replace Panzer II with Panzer III (50mm Cannon, Long), light tanks are actually 
useless and they are meant for scouting anyway, my mod is not realism focused 
but a 37mm cannon against a SU-100, SU-122? C'mon. Appendix: Actually no,
I'll just leave the light classes as it is. 



Tank Destroyer class? (Jagd Panther, Stug III/IV, Jagd Panzer IV) 
Panther/M10 should get 75mm Cannon

2nd Resource "Weapon"
Water Extractor
Material Atomizer


UNKNOWN:
Missile/Rocket Launcher, Pulse Machine Gun, 2x20mm AutoCannon,
Quad Machine Gun. Nuclear Rocket Launcher.


Totally different weapon concept:
Instead of having several weapons or so it I would prefer something like this
A vehicle has 3 weapon slot:
1 HEAVY/SPECIAL
2 LIGHT
3 LIGHT (via upgrade maybe) 
4 Unknown/Grenade Pods?

All of those weapon should be almost be fired in simoulatenous manner,
when the 1 HEAVY got the Cannon weapon for example it should have all
functionalities it had previously, at least the FIRE part. Since the 2 other
light weapon slot can be used for fast firing ones instead.
