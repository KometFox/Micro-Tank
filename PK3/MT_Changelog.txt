	 -Particle Effects doesnt have numbers in their location spawn

	 -Some changes to gameplay:
	  Instead of collecting items placed around the map
	  you have to build some structures to get resources and items.

	"Ammo"
	 -reduced ammo cap of LVL2 ammo from 15 (30 w/ backpack) to 8(16).

	 -All tanks have their own ammo type, smaller cannon have more ammo

	 -All shells have different speed and gravity which is universal for now
	 (i.e. 50mm HE shell has the same range as 75mm one)
	  the order is:
	  HEAT-RamJet->AP->HE->HEAT->Buckshot
	  on next update it will also take caliber on account which would be:
	  75mm->50mm->37mm
	  i.e. 
	  75mm AP -> 50mm AP

	 -Each Cannon Shell/Shot can be upgraded now 
	
	Changes to Cannon:
	  All different cannon type like Blahblah* AP, blah* HE cannot be selected
	  anymore instead you need to cycle the ammo type which needs to be binded 
	  in configuration menu named "Switch Cannon Ammo (Right)"
	
	75/50mm weapons:
	 -FAE rocket launcher 1st mode takes 1 ammo instead of 2 now.
	 -Fuel Air Explosive acts a bit more realistic 
	  (fuel gets dispended and then it explodes) and doesnt lay fire anymore.

	 -Material Maker
	  It will provide you resource which are essentials for getting 
	  ammunition and better items 
 
	 -Ore Refinery
	  its sole purpose is to refine comet raw ore
 
	 -Comet Catcher
	  Basically a upgraded Ore Extractor, it makes falling ore comets 
	  which gives comet materials later on when used on refinery

	 -Science Center
	  Here you can improve the performance of your weapons
	  and getting experimental weapons/items

	 -Ammo Factory
	  It is cheaper to build compared to the Arms Dealer
	  but you can only get lower ammo tiers like the HE, things like FAE or 
	  Laser ammo would not be available
